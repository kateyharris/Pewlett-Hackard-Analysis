## Summary
Based on employees qualified retirement age, analysis of Pewlett-Hackard employees born between 1952, and 1955,  qualify for retirement, that have not already retired!<br />
This event that anticipates such a huge number of employees retiring at the same time, has been coined the 	__*"silver tsunami."*__ <br />
When evaluating which of those  employees are retiring, more than half of them hold Senior titles, so tenured packages should be expected to have a large financial impact on the company. Current analysis is by title, but I would recommend further analysis by department as well.<br />
 roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact.<br />
 of those retiring hold the prestigious title of Senior Engineer, whose extensive experience and knowledge should be missed.<br />
Currently there are only 1 qualified, retirement-ready employees, in all departments, to mentor the next generation of Pewlett-Hackard employees.
